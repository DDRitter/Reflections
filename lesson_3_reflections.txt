When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have multiple physical work locations and I want to keep track of all the work.
Also, when I work in a collaborative project with other people.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote repository status does not need to be a working version at any times.
It's best to let the user decide when the remote repository has all the files ready for download.







Commands:

git push origin master  |  Publica los cambios en github
git pull origin master  |  Descarga los cambios de github a la copia local
